Network Cache
Web cache:
After calling any APIs to the server, it returns the data that has html, css, png, ...
We cache them in the browser, we don't need to call this APIs that is used to call.
So Doing this, it requires this data that has changes less or no changes.

Cache(RAM) vs DB(SSD or HDD) it's faster than 1m parts
Cache aside:
hacker attacks 2 step:
The first one: the 4 one is no data in DB
The hacker can attack to spam when he knows the API is returned no data
If spam so much, the server is overload -> dangaruos
How to fix:
When no data in DB, we also store the data into the cache with the null value and set expired time.
key,value -> key,NULL
it always is returned the value(NULL or the any value)

App call cache via network
The first one calling from the app to the cache:
Example:
cache has 1,Object_1 (1)
it responses (1) to the app and the app is stored the key with 1
When other call from the app to the cache:
it checks the key first if exsting this, it continues calling the cache otherwise it doesn't call

Trashing ***:
When the first request A call to the app
the app call to the cache and it return no data -> continue calling the db and storing in cache is A
When the second request B call to the app
the app call to the cache and it has only A data -> continue calling the db and storing in cache is B like replacement B
so the cache has only B currently.
Do this and do this, Cache still do store like this
Cache isn't the meaning in this case
This case when we have many user, many data, many data and cache only has data less
How to fix:
+ Upgrade size
+ Only store the data nessessary and the data that is rarely updated by the DB
+ Don't store the data unnessessary and the data that is always updated by the DB

When using this:
+ want to add the data into cache to no need to calculate again
+ no need to save the data in to the DB 
Why:
+ it stores in RAM
+ Using single thread (IO multithreading, OS, Linux Epoll)
+ Many data types

Disadvantages:
+ Size isn't big (will be expensive when wanna upgrade the size)
+ After shutdowning or restaring the server, the data in the cache are lost
