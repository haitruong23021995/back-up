Messages Enqueued : After producing to the queue (pub msg)
Messages Dequeued : After consuming to the queue (sub msg)
Number Of Consumers : After subcribing completed, still wait in the queue to get msg
Number Of Pending Messages  : After publishing completed, still wait in the queue to sub come and get this msg
Click Purse: remove all Number Of Pending Messages
Click Delete: remove all 
@Listener : always runnning async to receive the msg from Q(faster)
Embedded: converting Message<Payload> to Payload (general convert - MessageConverter )
factory.setConcurrency("3-1"); Number Of Consumers == 3 && Messages Dequeued  == 1
true: using jms topic (Pub/Sub structure), false: using jms queue (PTP structure)
factory.setPubSubDomain(false);
 
when using this (benefit):
+ The message broker guarantees that the message will not be lost if the consumer is unavailable.
+ Can sending to Message Broker by java and receving by other language
+ Independent of the system that sends it (Providing a means of communication between services that do not have to be running at the same time. The producer can send messages regardless of whether the consumer is active or not)
+ Increases system performance by introducing an asynchronous data transfer system. 
+ Increased reliability by guaranteeing the transmission of messages. If a consumer is not active at the time of sending the message, then there is a guarantee that the message will be read, as it will be stored in the broker.

Drawbacks(Disadvantage):
+ Debugging can be complicated. Imagine you have several stages of asynchronous request creation using the message broker, you send something, and you don't get a response, finding the problem can be very difficult 
+ Increases the complexity of the application system.
+ It's hard for the beginner.

Distributed transaction
A distributed transaction is a set of operations on data that is performed across two or more data repositories (especially databases). It is typically coordinated across separate nodes connected by a network, but may also span multiple databases on a single server.
