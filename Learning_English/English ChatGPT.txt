REPLAY:
Futhermore how to study:
Thank you for clarifying. It sounds like you're concerned about your English communication skills and vocabulary and want to improve quickly, especially since you're a software engineer and need to communicate well in English for your job. Here are a few suggestions that might help you improve:

Set achievable goals: Break your overall goal of improving your English communication skills down into smaller goals, such as learning 20 new words a day or practicing listening for 30 minutes a day. This will help you stay motivated and focused.

Read and listen to English: If you regularly read and listen to English material, such as news articles or podcasts, you'll begin to pick up common phrases and improve your understanding of English vocabulary and grammar.

Practice speaking: There's no better way to improve your speaking skills than by actually speaking. Look for opportunities to practice speaking English, such as joining a language exchange group or finding a language tutor.

Use a vocabulary app: There are many free apps available that can help you learn and practice new English vocabulary. Some of the popular ones include Duolingo, Memrise, and Quizlet.

Remember, improving your language skills takes time and effort. Stay motivated, work consistently, and don't be afraid to make mistakes - it's all part of the learning process.

Fixed from AI:
I have a limited vocabulary and I need to improve it quickly. I feel that my current vocabulary is not sufficient, and I lack confidence when speaking English. When I try to communicate with others, I struggle to express my ideas effectively, and they seem to have difficulty understanding me. This makes me feel awful, and I hate feeling this way. Every day, I try to learn 20 new words because I am a software engineer and improving my English language skills is important for my job. I recently realized that I need to study how to speak English better, as I have forgotten some of what I learned previously. I feel that my weak English communication skills are impacting my professional growth and salary potential. Therefore, I must focus on improving my English communication skills and expanding my vocabulary
