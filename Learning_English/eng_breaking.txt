Topic: 1I have a bit of a sweet tooth
"I have a bit of a sweet tooth, and there's a new Italian family restaurant near Cathy's house. She and her neighbors decided to have dinner there together.

Upon entering Melrose Italian restaurant, the host greeted them, 'Hi, welcome to Melrose Italian restaurant. Would you like some time to look over the menu?'

Cathy replied, 'No thanks, we already know what we like. Could we start with some appetizers?'

The host said, 'Certainly. Today's special is garlic bread. Would you like that?'

Cathy said, 'Yes, please. Do you think one order is enough for everyone in here?'

The host replied, 'It should be, but if you like, you could also get a salad to share.'

Cathy considered the suggestion and said, 'That's a good idea, but I'm worried that's too much, and we all want to order a main dish as well. How do you feel about ordering a few family-style dishes? If it's too much, you can take home the leftovers.'

The group agreed, and the host took their order.

When it was time to order dessert, the host informed them of their famous cheesecake, but Cathy declined and said, 'I'm watching my weight a little. Cake never helped anyone.'

However, one of the neighbors said, 'You're right, actually. Let's start with dessert. I'll have one slice of cheesecake, please.'

The host confirmed, 'So, one slice of cheesecake for you?'

But the neighbor replied, 'No, the whole thing.'"

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need any further assistance.
